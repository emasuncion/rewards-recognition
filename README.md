# Rewards and Recognition

*A chance to be acknowledged; A chance to commend fellow colleagues.*

This is the Global Education Team's Rewards & Recognition Application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
yarn
```

*Note: You may also use `npm` however, you may need to delete `yarn.lock`, but don't commit the `package.json` so that there won't be issues when another contributer clones and installs the dependencies.*

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

First clone the repository and navigate inside the directory
```bash
# clone the repository
$ git clone git@github.com:emasuncion/rewards-recognition.git
$ cd rewards-recognition
```

Then install the dependencies
```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install
```

After installing the dependencies, you can now serve the application

$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build && yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
